# Matplotlib-Challenge
# Background
In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
# In this challenge we: 
- Generated a summary statistics table
- Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot
- Generate a pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot 
- Found the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. 
- Generated a box and whisker plot
- Generated a line plot
- Generated a scatter plot
- Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. 

# Tools Used:
- Pandas
- Python 
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
